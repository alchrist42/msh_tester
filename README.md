# MSH-TESTER  

## Requirements

You can redirect the read line prompt with the following commands:  
``rl_outstream = stderr;`` - *before main loop*.  
``write(2, ...);`` - *for any error or info messages*  

## Usage. 
0. ! You must have your prompt and any other message/banner printed on ``STDERR`` (like bash). See above ^_^
1. Go into your minishell folder and clone this repo
2. Run ``cd msh_tester && bash test.sh all``
3. Run specific test by ``bash test.sh [echo exit pipe etc..]``
4. Experimental! leaks mode  ``bash test.sh all leaks``

## What does it test ?

- ``echo``
- ``cd + pwd``
- ``exit``
- ``pipe |``
- ``redirect > >> < << ``
- ``export``
- ``env``
- ``unset``
- ``exit status ($?)``
- ``syntax errors``
- ``quote (bonus)``
- ``oper (bonus) $$ || ()``
- ``wildcard (bonus)``

## What should you test by yourself ?

Almost everything :) This tester is not perfect and is not checking ``leaks`` and ``error messages``.<br>
Some tests'l be show another error codes.
Also it not good for checking projects with termcaps.

Feel free to improve this tester !
